Virtualization
Virtualization allows creating virtual machines (VMs) that work like physical computers. It’s managed by a hypervisor, which allocates hardware resources to VMs.

Types of Virtualization
1. Type 1 (Bare-Metal Virtualization)
What it is: Hypervisor runs directly on the hardware, without needing an OS.
Examples: Linux KVM ,VMware ESXi Server, Microsoft Hyper-V.
Use: Ideal for servers and enterprise systems.

2. Type 2 (Hosted Virtualization)
What it is: Hypervisor runs as software on a host OS.
Examples: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Player.
Use: Best for personal or testing purposes.

Key Difference
Type 1: Runs directly on hardware for better performance.
Type 2: Runs on an OS, easier for testing and personal use.



Three types of network cards
1. NAT
The VM able to access internet by using physical machine address

2. Bridged
The VM IP is open to outside newtwork. The VM servies are accessible to outside world

3. Host-only
The VM is restricted to physical machine. No internet. Can only communicate with other VM's with the same machine
